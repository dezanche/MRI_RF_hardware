# MRI_RF_hardware
This repository provides design files and documentation for radio frequency (RF) electronics (i.e., hardware) for use in nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In an MRI scanner RF signals are detected and processed to generate images from the object that is being scanned. These hardware modules were developed to upgrade a scanner that was assembled from parts made by various manufacturers. Standard precautions for working with MRI and NMR equipment must be followed.
